<h1><a id="obligitory-introduction" class="anchor"></a>Obligitory Introduction</h1>

<p>To the three of you who are reading this, thanks. I&rsquo;m starting this blog
mainly because I wanted to jump start my learning. I&rsquo;ve come a long way
in my technical learning, but I find myself coming to a plateau and need
something new to get me going again. Enter, my blog. Code shack, baby.</p>

<p>For to one of three people reading this who doesn&rsquo;t know who I am, here
is a quick introduction about me.</p>

<h3><a id="how-i-came-to-nerd" class="anchor"></a>How I Came to Nerd</h3>

<p>I initially picked up my technical chops by virtue of higher education.
I graduated in Information Systems Management at BYU. I learned java back then. With
no offense to my java brewing peers, that made me want to drop kick puppies.
I&rsquo;m not sure why I loathed coding so much, but for whatever reason, I
did. I was perfectly happy accepting a job after graduating that
certainly guaranteed I would never touch a code editor again. And there
was much rejoicing. </p>

<p>After about a year of doing pretty mindless IT auditing and consulting
at Ernst &amp; Young, I decided I needed to form an escape plan, because
that career wasn&rsquo;t happening. I had started listening to a lot of
podcasts at the time, and happened across <a href="http://thisweekinstartups.com">this week in startups</a> which talked about how the cool kids on
the block were using this newfangled programing language called Rails or
something like that. So I decided to dust off my old programming hat and hop back
on the nerd saddle again.</p>

<p>For the next year, I consumed code education like a Samoan would consume
the buffet line at Golden Corral. I started out hacking on this social
network for startup enthusiasts (like I pretended to be at the time)
which I called <a href="https://github.com/nelsonwittwer/disrupt">Disruptage</a>.
While I never actually launched the project, I did learn a ton in the
process. It actually took me around 6 months to get that sucker to the
sad state that it is in now, but it was worth every painful night of
coding. After reading a few books on learning rails (I recommend <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">The
Rails Tutorial</a> or <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4">Agile Web
Development with
Rails</a>)
I only really started to comprehend Ruby/Rails when I had something like
this that I <strong>really</strong> wanted to build.</p>

<h3><a id="transistion-to-fulltime" class="anchor"></a>Transistion to Full-time</h3>

<p>Out of some miracle, I persuaded <a href="http://moneydesktop.com">MoneyDesktop</a>
to hire me to code full-time. I was pretty green at the time, and I&rsquo;m
quite impressed they rolled the dice on me. When I first started at
MoneyDesktop though, it was like I started back at square one. They have a
pretty impressive enterprise ruby stack, that shredded my n00b mind into a
gazillion pieces. With some coaching, I was able to piece it all
together and I rolled my first big boy project: a public API for our
partner banks to consume our data.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m proud of my little path that brought me here. Within a year and
change,  I had
taught myself to code again, and rolled the majority of an API that
banks would actually pay for. I appreciate the people who got me here,
namely <a href="https://twitter.com/abrandoned">@abrandoned</a>, 
<a href="https://twitter.com/liveh2o">@liveh2o</a>, and
<a href="https://twitter.com/localshred">@localshred</a> for taking me on at
<a href="http://moneydesktop.com">MoneyDekstop</a> and coaching me as I learned to
put it all together.</p>

<h3><a id="next-steps-on-my-technical-pilgramage" class="anchor"></a>Next Steps on my Technical Pilgramage</h3>

<p>So it&rsquo;s been almost a year since I joined MoneyDesktop, and several
months since I finished that first project.
While I&rsquo;m proud of how far I have come, in many ways I still feel the
same way I felt when I first started out on this technical feat. I feel
like there is so much I don&rsquo;t understand, and that sucks. I feel like by
teaching myself and whatever humble audience I can find by way of this
blog, I can feel a little more confident in my craft. So here goes
nothing. Welcome to code shack, baby.</p>
